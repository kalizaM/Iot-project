<h2 style="color:SlateBlue;">What is a Sound Board? </h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">A sound board is the surface of a string instrument that the strings vibrate against, usually via some sort of bridge. Pianos, guitars, banjos, and many other stringed instruments incorporate soundboards</p1>

<h2 style="color:SlateBlue;"> Who is it for? </h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;"> Sound boards are for audio engineer's. They use a sound board to optimize the combined sounds by adjusting input levels, applying effects, equalization and dynamic processing. DJ''s, produsers, radio show host's also use them.</p>

<h2 style="color:SlateBlue;"> Real world applications</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;"> Sound Boards are used in everday life. Some people use it to make music but producers and sound engineers aren't the only people who use this. Have you ever watched one of those prank call youtube videos? The host usually changes their voice and pranks the caller. You can also use it on apps like discord to change your voice while talking to others.</p>
